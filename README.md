This is a Python project that is designed to generate every note in any Chord Type for any Music Key.
As an instrumentalist, I know the difficulties in remembering the notes of difficult Chord types like Minors, Augmented 7ths, Diminished chords etc.
Thus I have created this program using Python, where the instrumentalist enters the music key and the Chord type they want to know, 
then all the notes in that Chord type for that key will ve generated.
